# [InstallingSettingUpAndMoreCheatSheet](../blob/master/install_config_and_more_ubuntu_cheat_sheet.md)
This is more like a steps to be done on fresh install of OS.
this includes Ubuntu and Fedora tricks, most of them are borrowed
from other sites so that I have all the info in one place and not
to search for everything and may be skip some important steps.

I hope this will be useful to others and if you find that I should
change something then PM me.

Feel free post issues and add more, I would be more than happy if you PR this repo
